# rectangle-operator-overloading
C++ program to calculate 2 rectangle by +, -, ++, --, ==, and [] operators

1. (+) operator to increase the area of 2 intersecting rectangles
2. (-) operator to take the slice of 2 intersecting rectangles
3. (++) operator to increase the area of one of the rectangles by 2 times
4. (--) operator to decrease the area of one of the rectangles by 2 times (1/2 of initial area)
5. ([]) operator to take the property of rectangles (xMax, xMin, yMax, yMin)
6. (==) operator to determine if 2 rectangles intersect
